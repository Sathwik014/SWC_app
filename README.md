### üíæ Local Storage Details

| Data Type | Storage Method | File Used | Description |
|------------|----------------|-----------|--------------|
| Favourites | `GetStorage` | `favourites` key | Stores list of favourite recipes as JSON |
| Theme Mode | `GetStorage` | `isDarkMode` key | Stores boolean value for dark/light theme |

## üß† State Management & Local Storage

--The app uses **GetX** extensively for reactive state management, dependency injection, and route handling. All controllers and services are registered globally with `Get.put()` and accessed anywhere without context, ensuring clean and maintainable architecture.

--Favourites are handled using a dedicated `FavouriteService`, which stores the list of favourite recipes in an observable `RxList<RecipeModel>`. This list automatically updates the UI whenever changes occur, thanks to GetX‚Äôs reactivity.

--Local persistence is implemented using **GetStorage**, a lightweight key-value storage system. Each time the favourites list changes, the updated data is serialized via `toJson()` and saved locally. On app startup, the data is read back into memory, ensuring users never lose their saved recipes even after restarting the app.

--In short ‚Äî **GetX** powers the app‚Äôs reactivity, routing, and dependency management, while **GetStorage** ensures persistent and seamless offline access to user favourites.
